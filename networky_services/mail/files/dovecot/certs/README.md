#WARNING!!!

These certificates/private key files are for use with services set up by
Puppet in this Vagrant environment. They are placed in Git so that
services needing SSL/TLS certificates and private keys can be set up
more quickly for experimentation/learning.

They are only for use **only** with VMs in this Vagrant
environment. Because they are commited into the Git repository and are
publicly available, they **should not** be used in **any** sort of
production environment.

**DO NOT USE THESE CERTIFICATES/KEYS IN ANY PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!**
